    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Steve Wozniak, full name; Stephen Gary Wozniak, was born on August 11th 1950 and was Steve Jobs co-founder of the company, Apple.
      Wozniak is best known for creating the computer series that made Apple into a major company for family computing, the Apple II series. 
      While Wozniak created the computer sereis that kickstarted Apple, he was shawdoed by Steve Jobs because Jobs presented himself more, while Wozniak was more shy and wanted to stay away from the spot light.
      Still, Steve Wozniak is one of the greatest minds in computing and deserves to be recognized.</p>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>

      <p>As stated before, Steve Wozniak was born on August 11th, 1950 and his father, Lockheed Martin, was an electrical engineer for the Lockheed Missles and Space Company.
        At a younge age, Wozniak was fascinated by electronics to the point where he would build his own electronics from scratch.
        However, with this accoplishment, he was not a star student in school, in a traditional sense at least.
        However, he was in the Homebrew Computer Club which focused on the Altari 8800 do-it-yourself kit, which inspired him to later make his own mircrocomputer in 1976.
        After graduation, Wozniak went to college at University of Colorado for one year, he dropped out and went to the University of California instead.
        While Steve was in college at the Univeristy of California he met Steve Jobs, who was only in high school, through a mutual friend.
        Overtime, the two Steves made a great friend ship and eventually in 1976, created the company Apple Computer.
        This made Wozniak quit his job at Hewlett-Packard, but from what he accomplished later in life, it shows that he did not make a mistake.

      <h2>The Beggining of Apple Computers</h2>
      <p>The first Apple Computer was nameded the Apple I, created in 1976 and was built in Steve Jobs' garage.
        However, although it was the company's first computer, only 200 units were sold.
        The Apple I was the predecessor to the computer that would make Apple a big name in the home computer buisness, that computer, was the Apple II.
        The Apple II was one of the "Big Three" in 1977 along with Commodore's PET and the TRS-80 Model 1.
        However, the Apple II was the most expensive out of the three computers, strating at around 1,298 dollars with four kilobytes of ram, or 2,638 dollars for 48 kilobytes.
        This is the price before inflation, it was pricy, but also affordable for some homes.
        To compare, the Commodore PET was 795 dollars, and the TRS-80 Model 1 cost 600 dollars.
        While it was on the higher end of the competition, the Apple II still sold six million units.

      <h2>Later Life</h2>
      <p>In 1981, Steve Wozniak was piloting a plane out of Santa Cruz Sky Park, he was soon hospitalized after he crashed it.
        He survived, thankfully, but his recovery took two years and he also suffered from amnesia. 
        After the recovery, Wozniak went back to Apple in 1982, but resisted against working in management.
        Steve Wozniak left the company in 1985 as an active employee.
        When Wozniak left Apple, he stayed in the computing industry by funding multiple buisness ventures.
        He also was in advertisement and board members a few times.
        In 2006, Wozniak published his first biography of himself: <i>iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing</i>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Steve Wozniak, while hidden behind Steve Jobs, desrves to be recognized as one of the founding fathers of home computing.
        The legacy he created with Apple and other comapnys should be recogniazed by everyone.
        From the beggining of the Apple I, all the way to 2019, Steve Wozniak had made an impact on millions, maybe even billions, of people.
        Woznaik will always be important to computing, no matter how far in the future computing goes.
