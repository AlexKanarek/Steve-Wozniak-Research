  <div class="title">
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Steve Wozniak, full name; Stephen Gary Wozniak, was born on August 11th 1950 and was Steve Jobs co-founder of the company, Apple.
      Wozniak is best known for creating the computer series that made Apple into a major company for family computing, the Apple II series. 
      While Wozniak created the computer sereis that kickstarted Apple, he was shawdoed by Steve Jobs because Jobs presented himself more, while Wozniak was more shy and wanted to stay away from the spot light.
      Still, Steve Wozniak is one of the greatest minds in computing and deserves to be recognized.</p>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>

      <p>As stated before, Steve Wozniak was born on August 11th, 1950 and his father, Lockheed Martin, was an electrical engineer for the Lockheed Missles and Space Company.
        At a younge age, Wozniak was fascinated by electronics to the point where he would build his own electronics from scratch.
        However, with this accoplishment, he was not a star student in school, in a traditional sense at least.
        However, he was in the Homebrew Computer Club which focused on the Altari 8800 do-it-yourself kit, which inspired him to later make his own mircrocomputer in 1976.
        After graduation, Wozniak went to college at University of Colorado for one year, he dropped out and went to the University of California instead.
        While Steve was in college at the Univeristy of California he met Steve Jobs, who was only in high school, through a mutual friend.
        Overtime, the two Steves made a great friend ship and eventually in 1976, created Apple Computer.
        This made Wozniak quit his job at Hewlett-Packard, but from what he accomplished later in life, it shows that he did not make a mistake.

      <h2>The Beggining of Apple Computers</h2>
      <p>The first Apple Computer was nameded the Apple I, created in 1976 and was built in Steve Jobs' garage.
        The Apple I was the predecessor to the computer that would make Apple a big name in the home computer buisness, that computer, was the Apple II.
        The Apple II was one of the "Big Three" in 1977 along with Commodore's PET and the TRS-80 Model 1.
        However, the Apple II was the most expensive out of the three computers, strating at around 1,298 dollars with four kilobytes of ram, or 2,638 dollars for 48 kilobytes.
        This is not in today's money, this is what it cost in 1977.
        To compare, the Commodore PET was 795 dollars, and the TRS-80 Model 1 cost 600 dollars.
